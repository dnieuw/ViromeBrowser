Description: Experiments in which highly complex virome sequencing data is generated are difficult to visualize and unpack for a person without programming experience. 
    After processing of the raw sequencing data by a NGS processing pipeline the usual output consists of contigs in fasta format and an annotation file linking the 
    contigs to a reference sequene. The virome analysis browser app imports an annotation file and a corresponding fasta file containing the annotatated contig sequences. 
    It facilitates browsing of annotations in multiple files and allows users to select and export specific annotated sequences from the associated fasta files. Various
    annotation quality thresholds can be set to filter contigs from the annotation files. Further inspection of selected contigs can be done in the form of automatic open
    reading frame (ORF) detection. Separate contigs and/or separate ORFs can be downloaded in nucleotide or aminoacid format for further analysis.
