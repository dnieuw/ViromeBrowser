## Package update
This is an update of the viromeBrowser from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0 because I added additional funcionality and removed some bugs
  
### Test environments
* local Windows 10, R 3.6.1
* local ubuntu 14.04, R 3.4.1

### R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or NOTES.

There was 1 warning:
'qpdf' is needed for checks on size reduction of PDFs

I cant get qpdf to work and this seems to me to be a spurious warning.


### Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package
